# Critic brief: loop 8

You are an independent, deliberately harsh visual critic. You are reviewing **Spa City Tub Rally**, a browser
(three.js) bathtub kart racer on the real streets of Hot Springs, Arkansas, that is being restyled as a **glossy
plastic brick-toy world**: original brick figures (not minifigures) push bathtubs on wheels while a captain steers.
You judge it against shipped brick-toy games. Your scores feed a development loop: inflated scores waste the
developer's time, and deflated ones without evidence get thrown out by the judge. Be exact and cite.

You have not seen any earlier score, any other reviewer, or the developer's opinion. Don't look for them:
`games/Cart Racing/reviews/HISTORY.md`, `games/Cart Racing/reviews/history.json`, any `ab-key.json`, and every other
`games/Cart Racing/reviews/loop-*/` folder are off limits.

## Read first
- Rubric: `games/Cart Racing/reviews/RUBRIC.md` (anchors, gates, evidence rule, the IP check).
- Output schema: `games/Cart Racing/reviews/schema.json`.
- Benchmarks: `games/Cart Racing/benchmarks/README.md` and the images it lists. They are a quality bar, not a design to
  copy: this game deliberately avoids minifigure shapes and LEGO branding.

## A/B comparison
83 pairs in `screenshots/review-loop-8/ab/`. Each image shows the same moment from two builds, **A** on the left and **B** on the right. One of them is this loop's build and the other is the previous one; which is which is hidden from you, and A is the same build in every pair.

For each of the 10 categories, say which build is better on the evidence of the pairs that bear on it — `A`, `B`
or `tie` — with a confidence (0–1) and the pairs you used. Call a tie when the difference is within what you'd
expect from noise. Judge each category on its own; don't let one big change colour the rest.

## What changed this loop (facts only)
# Loop 8: changes (facts only)

## Scenery
- **Judge stops:** each judge booth has a navy sign board standing on its roof across the booth, facing up and down
  the road. It spells JUDGE on both faces in white 1×1 plates (a 3×5 brick font). The booth gets a blue feather flag
  and two red bands round its white body. For each race, spectators within 6 m and trees within 5 m of a judge booth
  are removed, so the judges stand in clear view.
- **Horizon:**
  - Hills 30 m or taller step back in three terraces (28 m deep), with the summit furthest away. Each terrace has a
    lit top and a lit lip on the riser below it.
  - The conifer crowns on the hill faces vary their spacing from row to row (5.5–9 m), sit off-centre in their cells
    and thin into clearings along the ring.
  - Low uses 3° columns (was 2°).
- **Goat Rock:** the outcrop is now stacked long plates with studded tops instead of a masonry brick-course
  texture.
- **Landmarks with painted facades** keep only their sloped glass (roof lanterns, skylights). Their upright
  modelled panes are gone; these stood in front of the painted windows and were offset from them.

## Materials
- **Pitched roofs** (landmark and bathhouse roofs) are laid in brick-high tile rows with lit lips. Only near-flat
  roofs take studs.
- **Lawns:** baseplates keep a moulded groove every 16 studs (4.48 m), and each plate gets its own shade, so lawns
  keep their build at mid distance.
- **Creek ford:** more opaque and bluer. White edge lines run along both road edges across it.
- **Particles** (steam, spray, splashes) are translucent beads with a glassy rim (about 50% opaque at the centre,
  85% at the rim). Before, they were opaque.

## Lighting
- **Dusk and sunset crews:**
  - The fill is raised to 0.32 (was 0.22) and the sky rim to 0.6 (was 0.35).
  - Rival rings are brighter (90% opacity, was 60%) and wider at dusk.
- **Dusk lamp pools** are centred 3 m out from each lamp toward the road.
- **Park Avenue (dusk):** ambient raised to 0.64 (was 0.42) and key light to 0.55 (was 0.45).
- **Sun shadows:**
  - On world surfaces the depth bias grows on faces turned edge-on to the sun.
  - Crews use a looser bias, because they cast from their far model, whose blocks stand a few centimetres proud of
    the rounded near parts. This removes the hatching on the backs of heads, and the chassis still casts.
- **High-tier ambient occlusion** fades out within 2.5–5 m of the camera. This removes the banding on a tub's curved
  inner wall in close-ups.

## Animation and feel
- **Impacts** dip the camera by up to about 4°. The dip eases out with the shake, plus a smaller ring. Before, the
  kick was a ring of about 1.5°.
- **Slide steam** rises at about 1.6 m/s or more and trails back from the tub. Boost steam swells faster (2.6× per
  second).

## UI and mobile
- **HUD tiles** carry the menus' stud row along their top edge.
- **Phone landscape:** event banners sit below the item tile (they covered its lower edge).
- **Ticket count:** a count of one reads "1 TICKET".
- **Phone portrait team select** keeps a 16 px margin above the bottom edge (plus the safe area).

## Review harness
- **R15** (fumble): the strip starts one tick after the hit, so frame 1 is the impact (it started two ticks after).

## Performance (measured; vsync off)

(vsync off: fps above 60 is headroom, not what players see. "swiftshader" is software GL, a pessimistic phone-GPU floor.)

## Write
1. A verdict in one paragraph.
2. For each of the 10 categories: the score, then why, citing captures by path (for example `high/desktop/R04`,
   `crops/high/R02-preview`, `strips/high/R15`) and the benchmark you compared against.
3. The IP check: anything that resembles a minifigure silhouette or LEGO branding (say "clean" if nothing does).
4. The ranked gaps: the specific visual defects or shortfalls that cost the most points, each with a concrete,
   testable fix, an expected gain, a severity (1–5) and an effort (S/M/L). Name the workstream: WS1 render,
   materials and lighting; WS2 characters and tubs; WS3 animation; WS4 scenery, terrain and landmarks; WS5 crowds,
   trees and props; WS6 UI, HUD and mobile framing; WS7 performance and tiers.
5. **The last thing in your reply:** one fenced ```json block per schema.json, with `"role": "critic-claude (Critic A) or critic-codex (Critic B), as assigned"`,
   `"loop": 8`, `"tier": "high"`, `ab` (from loop 1 on) and `ip`.
